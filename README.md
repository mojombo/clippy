Clippy - Helping you copy text to your clipboard
================================================

Clippy is a very simple Flash widget that makes it possible to place arbitrary
text onto the client's clipboard. Here is what Clippy looks like on GitHub:

Here is a sample Rails (Ruby) helper that can be used to place Clippy on a
page:

    def clippy(text, bgcolor='#FFFFFF')
      html = <<-EOF
        <object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000"
                width="110"
                height="14"
                id="clippy" >
        <param name="movie" value="/flash/clippy.swf"/>
        <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" />
        <param name="quality" value="high" />
        <param name="scale" value="noscale" />
        <param NAME="FlashVars" value="text=#{text}">
        <param name="bgcolor" value="#{bgcolor}">
        <embed src="/flash/clippy.swf"
               width="110"
               height="14"
               name="clippy"
               quality="high"
               allowScriptAccess="always"
               type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
               pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"
               FlashVars="text=#{text}"
               bgcolor="#{bgcolor}"
        />
        </object>
      EOF
    end

Installation (Pre-Built SWF)
---------------------------

If you want to use Clippy unmodified, just copy `build/clippy.swf` to your
`public` directory or wherever your static assets can be found. The file is 
compiled for Flash 9 and above.

Installation (Compiling)
------------------------

In order to compile Clippy from source, you need to install the following:

* [haXe](http://haxe.org/)
* [swfmill](http://swfmill.org/)

The haXe code is in `clippy.hx`, the button images are in `assets`, and the
compiler config is in `compile.hxml`. Make sure you look at all of these to
see where and what you'll need to modify. To compile everything into a final
SWF, run the following from Clippy's root directory:

    swfmill simple library.xml library.swf && haxe compile.hxml

If that is successful, copy `build/clippy.swf` to your
`public` directory or wherever your static assets can be found.
